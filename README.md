## Data Sets Used
### 1. [Park Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/parks1) 
#### Description:
    This data set shows what parks are in certain areas of Pittsburgh
### 2. [Fire Incidents](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh)
#### Description: 
    This data set shows the incidents of fire responded to by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire
### 3. [Police Arrests](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data) and [Crime Rate](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/a-community-profile-of-pittsburgh-neighborhoods-1974)
#### Description:
    [Police Arrests]: This data set shows arrest data that contains information on people taken into custody by City of Pittsburgh police officers. More serious crimes such as felony offenses are more likely to result in an arrest. However, arrests can occur as a result of other offenses, such as parole violations or a failure to appear for trial. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level. This dataset only contains information reported by City of Pittsburgh Police. It does not contain information about incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (for example, campus police or Port Authority police).
    
    [Crime Rate]: These data include four historical datasets that were transcribed from the Community Profiles of Pittsburgh reports, which were published in 1974. The Community Profiles were prepared for 71 Pittsburgh neighborhoods by the City of Pittsburgh's Department of City Planning and include demographic information, housing, socio-economic conditions, and community facilities. The four datasets included here are data on building permits issued in 1972, arrests for major crimes in 1972, public assistance given in 1972, and community facilities serving and located in Pittsburgh neighborhoods.
